### Adapter is a structural design-pattern that allows object with incompatible interfaces to collaborate .

#### Applicability :
    - use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class,but its interface isn't compatible with the rest of your code.
    - use the pattern when you want to reuse several existing subclasses that lack some common functionality that can't be added to the superclass
