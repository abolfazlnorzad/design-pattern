### Composite is structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

#### Applicability:
    - use the pattern when you have to implement a tree-like object structure.
    - use the pattern when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.
