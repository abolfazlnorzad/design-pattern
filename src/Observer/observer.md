### Observer is a behavioral design pattern that let you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.

#### Applicability:
    - use the pattern when changes to the state of one object my require changing  other objects and the actaul set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically
    - use the pattern when some objects in your app must observe other,but only for a limited time or in specific cases.
