### strategy is a behavioral design pattern tha lets you define a family of algorithms,put each of them into a separate class,and make their objects interchangeable.


#### Applicability:
    - use the pattern when you want to use diffrent variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
    - use the strategy when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.
    - use the pattern to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not be as important in the context of that logic.
