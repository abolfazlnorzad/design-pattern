### Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors

#### Applicability:
    - use the pattern when you need to be able to design extra behaviors object at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects.
    - use the pattern when it's awkward or not possible to extend an object's behavior using inheritance.
