### flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of ram by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

#### Applicability:
    - use the pattern only when your program must support a huge number of objects wich barely fit into available ram.
