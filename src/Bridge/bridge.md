### bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies--abstraction and implementation-witch can be developed independently of each other.

#### Applicability:
    - use the bridge pattern when you want to divide and organize a monolithic class
        that has serveral variants of some functionality 
        (for example,if the class can be work with various datavase servers.)
    - use the pattern when you need to extend a class in serveral orthogonal (independent) dimensions.
    - use the bridge if you need to be able to switch implementations at runtime.
