### factory method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating object in a superclass , but allows subclasses to alter the type of object that will be created .(driver base : cache ,db , log , ....)


#### Applicability:
    - use the factory method when you don't know beforehand the exact of types and depenedcies of the object your codes should be work with
    - use the factory method when you want to provide users of your library or fraework with a way to extend is internal components
    - use the factory method when you want to save system resources by reusing exising objects instead of rebuilding them each time.
