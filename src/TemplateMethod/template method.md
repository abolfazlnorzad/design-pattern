### template method is A behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclass override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.


#### Applicability: 
    - use the pattern when you want to let clients extend only practiculatr steps of an algorithm ,but not the whole algorithm or its structure.
    - use the pattern when you have several classes that contain almost identical algorithms with some minor differences.as a result you might need to modify both classes when the algorithm changes.
